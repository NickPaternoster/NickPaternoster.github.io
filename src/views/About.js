        <h1>Cognitive Neuroscientist | Cornell University</h1>
        <p>Hi!</p>
        <p>My name is Nick and I'm a second year Ph.D. student in the Attention, Memory, & Perception lab under Khena Swallow at Cornell
          University.
        </p>
        <p>In 2023 I graduate from the University of Central Arkansas with a bachelors majoring in computer science and minoring in cognitive science. During my time 
          at UCA I became involved in the Perceptual Cognitive Neuroscience lab headed by Dr. Amrita Puri and it is during my stint as an undergraduate research assistant that
          I found a passion for investigating perception and the brain. The research I assisted with was primarily investigating numerical cognition (the size congruity effect) and
          human echolocation, a project that was guided by one of my mentors Dr. Santani Teng at the Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of the lab I interned at a number of companies, where I was able to work as a professional software engineer. Gaining familarity with modern tech stacks, version control techniques, and 
          industry standard workflow management. I was also employed as a teachning assistant where I led lab sessions for the introductory C++ course at the university. 
          During my time at UCA I was able to spend some time becoming familiar with modern machine learning techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          Linking my industry experience with my research in I joined the AMP lab in 2023, where I now utilize machine learning to model human cognition and perception.
